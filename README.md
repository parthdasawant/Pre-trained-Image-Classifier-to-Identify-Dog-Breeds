# Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds

Image Classification for a City Dog Show
Project Goal
Improving your programming skills using Python.
In this project, I use a created image classifier to identify dog breeds. It is for one of the submission for the udacity nanodegree program

Description:
Your city is hosting a citywide dog show and you have volunteered to help the organizing committee with contestant registration. Every participant that registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog. The registration system tags the images based upon the biographical information.
